```

## Project detail
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r }
# load plotly
library(plotly)
```

### Plot with plotly
```{r}
library(plotly)
fig <- plot_ly(y = ~rnorm(50), type = "box")
fig <- fig %>% add_trace(y = ~rnorm(50, 1))

fig
```
